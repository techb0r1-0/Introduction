# Introduction
I’m Alejandro Lopez, a Senior Developer at Evil Corp LLC 💻. I spend my days building systems that actually work and keeping things running smoothly ⚙️. I help figure out the big-picture stuff, clean up messy code, and try to make life easier for the rest of the team 🤝. I like tackling tricky problems and finding simple, practical ways to solve them 🚀.
